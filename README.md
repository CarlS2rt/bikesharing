# NYC Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the NYC bike share program to determine if a similar model could be employed in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis utilizes Tableau to present data visualizations and tell a clear story for investors. The Tableau story can be found here: [NYC Citibike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carl.stewart/viz/CitirideBikeShareData/NYCCitibikeAnalysis#1)

## Analysis and Results

### Top Starting Locations

Location plays an important role in determining where to place the Bike Shares. In general, tourist areas see the highest concentrated use of the bikes. Though tourism is a factor, it does not represent the entirety of the user base for the service. 

### Average Trip by Age

Age does play some role in the duration of the bike share trips, as younger people do tend to ride longer, but riders of ages have fairly consistent average trip durations. As such, age does not significantly impact the target demographic for users. 

### Checkout Durations

The vast majority of bike rides are only 5 minutes in length, and there are virtually no trips that last longer than 60 minutes. As such, the majority of rides seem to be short durations that would cover walkable distances. 

### Checkout Duration by Gender

Gender, it seems, does play a role in ridership. Males represent a much larger share of total riders  and tend to have slightly longer rides on average. 

### Trips by Weekday and Hour

Overall, trips can easily be divided into weekdays and weekends. Each category has its own trends. Weekdays tend to be busiest during the morning and evening commute hours. Weekends tend to be busiest from 10am to 7pm when people are out and most active. 

### Trips by Weekday and Hour by Gender

The overall trend for trip days and times manifests itself across genders as well, but follows the gender trends mentioned before in that males represent a much larger share of the ridership. 

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

When you add in whether the rider was a subscriber, you can see that a much larger percentage of all genders are subscribers. Males again represent a much larger share overall. 

## Summary

Overall, the target demographics for ridership skew heavily toward males and slightly toward the Millennials.  Age overall is not a huge factor, but it does show the youngest generation does ride longer than others. Additionally, the average trip duration is very short at 5-6 minutes. From this,  we can conclude that rides are primarily to get between two points rather than to just take a ride. This also coincides with high ridership during the morning and evening commute times. 

Some additional data visualizations may prove useful to help elaborate on when trips take place. Adding data for the duration of trips by weekday and hour would also be beneficial to determine the impact of commuting and if more joy-riding occurs on weekends. You could further break this data down by gender and by age as well if desired. 

In conclusion, we can surmise that bike shares open up new commuting opportunities for the community and alternate means of getting between destinations while out. Bike shares are great for tourist areas, but with high-use concentrations around commute times, they also greatly benefit local residents.
